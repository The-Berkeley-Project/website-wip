          Built on the collective drive to improve our community, The Berkeley
          Project has worked with over 100 organizations around the Bay Area.
          Each year, we devote a total of <strong>12,000+ hours</strong> saving
          over <strong>$400,000</strong> in labor costs. More importantly, we
          connect the students of Berkeley to members of the city creating a
          more tight-knit space to live and learn.

          While planning Berkeley Project Day is the main objective, committee
          members build lasting relationships with community leaders by
          volunteering at sustained sites throughout the semester. These sites
          give us the opportunity to engage in community service just as our
          volunteers do during Berkeley Project Day.
